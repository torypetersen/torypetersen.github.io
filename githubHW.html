    <h1>The Dominance of Overseas Players in the NBA.</h1>
    <h2>Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Victor Wembanyama</h2>
    <p>The best and most promising players in the league right now are arriving from different pro leagues in different countries. This might be surprising because, generally, NBA teams dominate other countrys' teams so thoroughly that we don't consider their ability. The thing is, some of these other countries place an emphasis on fundamentals and unselfish basketball that many US players seem to lack. This training, combined with generational talents has been creating some of the most dominant players in recent history. As a basketball fan that has not kept up with the sport in years, the NBA is once again incredibly interesting and hard to look away from. </p>
